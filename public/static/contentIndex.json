Again as an example, a new feature request like ‚Äúshowing x information on main screen‚Äù would contain these work bits:\n\nWork in the UX/UI that will display the information\nWork in the service layer to transform the information\nWork in the database layer to store / fetch the information.\nWikipedia\n\n\nI like the analogy with a cake from this post.\n\nPeople don‚Äôt eat layers of a cake.

Again, looking at the cake as the whole product,\n\nUser stories come to play\nOne way to try achieving a vertical slice is by focusing the stories on the end user.\nThat‚Äôs why we call a feature ‚Äúuser¬†story‚Äù, and it is common to follow the format ‚ÄúAs a user, I can update Client‚Äù. This format reminds us that the goal is to deliver valuable software to the end user. When that‚Äôs too big, the goal is to find the sweet spot by reducing the scope in all layers. For example, we could reduce the scope by changing the story to ‚ÄúAs a user, I can update the title of a Client‚Äù.\nBut I don‚Äôt know frontend‚Ä¶\nIt is tempting and natural for engineers to split within layers. That is logically easier. It is more comfortable to pick a backend task up if you know the backend. But remember, you are part of a team, and your team should be able to deliver a task touching all the layers at once. More than one person can be working in the same task at once, getting in sync and focusing on delivering the piece of the cake together. You, as a team player, can still work on what you work best, but everyone can be focused on delivering that piece of cake, or even a cupcake if that allows you to get more insights and deliver more value at this iteration.\nBe ready to change\nThis idea, to be implemented, will likely require your team to change their ways of working, trying new ways to deliver value. You are not do it right in the first iteration‚Ä¶ Keep moving, keep reviewing and trying other ways to deliver value faster.\n\nJust a reminder that all of these are guidelines, not rules. They are analogies to help us deliver value faster, which does not apply to all cases. For example, it is common to have to do work beforehand to deliver value easier later.

Let‚Äôs choose public groups and websites over closed groups behind a username and password\n\nMy first car was a VW Beatle 1977. I believe that‚Äôs were my ‚Äúpassion‚Äù to understand and fix cars started. It actually started because I didn‚Äôt have much money and a 30 years old car is likely to fail at some point. üò¨\nFor any brand or car imaginable, we would have a public forums with people asking questions and helping each other. It was lovely. ‚ÄúIn the olds days‚Ä¶ üòÜ‚Äú. I recently bought a Mahindra Pik Up, it‚Äôs not the most popular truck in NZ, and it was not straight forward to find help searching online or asking AI.\nWhat is my view?\nAll these forums have now moved to Facebook Groups, WhatsApp groups, LinkedIn or any other social media group. Result, all of that knowledge is now enclosed in a non-public place. All of this knowledge is not searchable. You need to be part of that group to find the knowledge. But, it‚Äôs hard to know what you don‚Äôt know. So if you don‚Äôt know about the groups, you may be left alone in the beach by yourself, singing a song and feeling a bit frustrated.\nWith the advance of LLMs (AI), things are not getting better. We are now asking the AI, getting good and bad answers, but we are not sharing this interaction with anyone. The result‚Ä¶ this knowledge is enclosed behind a a username and password. The LLM that you are using can get better, as they can train themselves based on your interactions, but that‚Äôs it. No other LLM will be trained by that chat you had.\nIt‚Äôs not all bad, don‚Äôt get me wrong. The open public spaces are still here, indexable and with human interactions. A good example is Reddit, you can find any topic there, and it‚Äôs public. Result, we are building knowledge together.\nOn thesoftware-development area, we have Stack overflow. If you worked as a software engineer, you used it at some point. Please, keep posting things there (I‚Äôm probably talking to myself here), build knowledge for us all, not only for the big tech to train their models and give us answers without a reference.\nThat‚Äôs my call‚Ä¶ share what you know in a public space. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs your website, a forum, Medium, X, YouTube, whatever‚Ä¶ just choose something that‚Äôs indexable and public."},"Zettelkasten/Notes-in-only-one-place":{"title":"Notes in only one place","links":["Zettelkasten/Write-it-down-to-solve-it"],"tags":["productivity"],"content":"I‚Äôve used Evernote in the past with good success, but it started getting too slow for my liking and I stopped.\nKindly they allow you to migrate all your notes elsewhere.\nAdopting Obsidian\nI need a place to start the Write it down to solve it idea.
